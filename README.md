# Welcome to the NextJS wagmi demo ðŸ‘‹
This repo servers as a minimal template for integrating the wagmi React hooks for Ethereum library with Typescript & NextJS. Due to its ease of customizability and extensibility, this template has been styled with the Tailwind CSS framework. Let's get to it!
### Check out the live demo ðŸ‘‰ [NextJS wagmi](https://nextjs-wagmi.vercel.app/)

## Get up and running in 3 simple steps:

### 1. Create an app using this repo as the template
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/Seth-McKilla/nextjs-wagmi
```
>Note: The above command automatically downloads and installs the dependencies so no "npm install" or "yarn add" required!

### 2. Create a .env.local file within the root directory with the following environment variables
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID=<insert infura id>
```
>Note: Grab an Infura ID from the [Infura website](https://infura.io/)

### 3. Start the local development environment
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

That's it, you're all set!
